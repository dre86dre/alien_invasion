# Alien Invasion

Welcome to the Alien Invasion Game! This is a simple 2D game created using Python and Pygame. The objective of the game is to shoot down as many alien ships as possible before they invade your base.

## Introduction

Alien Invasion is inspired by the classic arcade game "Space Invaders". This project aims to provide a fun way to learn and practice Python and Pygame. The game includes a simple GUI, collision detection, and increasing levels of difficulty.

## Features

- **Player Controls**: Move the spaceship left and right and shoot bullets.
- **Alien Waves**: Increasing difficulty with faster aliens as levels progress.
- **Collision Detection**: Detects when bullets hit aliens or when aliens reach the base.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the player's score.
- **Level Progression**: Keeps track on what level the player is on.

## How to Play

- **Movement**: Use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship.
- **Shooting**: Press the spacebar to shoot bullets at the aliens. Only 3 bullets are allowed for the player to shoot at one time!
- **Objective**: Shoot down all the aliens before they reach your base. Each level increases the speed.
